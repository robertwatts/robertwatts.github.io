Currently, I'm happily building the stack that drives [Wonderbly](https://www.wonderbly.com). As VP of Engineering, I lead a multi-disciplinary team to help ensure our inspiring ideas for children are published and sold.

Prior to Wonderbly I was Chief Software Architect at MTT, a provider of apps and products for the travel industry, where I led the design and development of their [award-winning](https://digital.travelport.com/news/travelport-digital-concierge-live-wins-at-the-mobile-innovation-awards) product suite. I was heavily involved in the successful [acquisition of MTT by Travelport](https://www.phocuswire.com/Travelport-acquires-Mobile-Travel-Technologies-for-Euro-55-million).

Before MTT I was located in New York as a Technical Lead at [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com). I worked on science and learning platforms such as OnlineLibrary and WileyPlus. During which time I helped to deliver the [Frommer's acquisition by Google](https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3240794/google-frommers-acquisition-announcement).

Before moving to NYC I worked at Whatsonwhen, a travel startup, leading a small but awesome dev team. In the end, [we were acquired by Wiley](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20061018005847/en/Wiley-Acquires-Whatsonwhen-Online-Travel-Content-Services) as part of their Frommer's business.</p>

And finally, somewhere close to the beginning, I co-founded Weather Index as CTO, which is now a long defunct startup. We raised some cash and tried to make it work. It was fun, I'll tell you about it one day.
