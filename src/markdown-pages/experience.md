Since 2016 I've been building the personalisation platform that drives [Wonderbly](https://www.wonderbly.com). As VP of Engineering, I lead a multi-disciplinary teams to bring our inspiring ideas to life and to market.

In 2014 I joined MTT, a provider of apps and products for the travel industry, at Chief Software Architect. I led the design and development of their [award-winning](https://digital.travelport.com/news/travelport-digital-concierge-live-wins-at-the-mobile-innovation-awards) product suite. I was heavily involved in the successful [acquisition of MTT by Travelport](https://www.phocuswire.com/Travelport-acquires-Mobile-Travel-Technologies-for-Euro-55-million).

Between 2008 and 2014, located in NYC, I was a Technical Lead for [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com). I worked on initiatives for their science and learning platforms such as OnlineLibrary and WileyPlus. I was involved in the [Frommer's acquisition by Google](https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3240794/google-frommers-acquisition-announcement).

Prior to moving to NYC I worked at a travel startup called Whatsonwhen, leading a small but awesome dev team. In the end, [we were acquired by Wiley](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20061018005847/en/Wiley-Acquires-Whatsonwhen-Online-Travel-Content-Services) as part of their Frommer's business.

And finally, in the early 2000s, I co-founded Weather Index as CTO, which is now a long defunct startup. We raised some cash and tried to make it work. It was fun, I'll tell you about it one day.
