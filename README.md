My professional website, built using Gatsby, Typescript + Markdown.

I am not a front-end developer and this website testifies to that fact.

## Content structure

All page content is in src/markdown-pages.

The website will follow a simple structure:

- `/` - homepage (index.md)
- `/work` - who I have worked for (work.md)
- `/coach` - who I can help (coach.md)
- `/articles` - content I have written (articles.md)
- `/contact` - how to get in touch (contact.md)
