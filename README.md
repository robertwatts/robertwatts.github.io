[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d4c47a9e-4bfd-45a5-a287-396fa7272621/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zen-spence-e39215/deploys)

My professional website, built using Gatsby, Typescript + Markdown.

I am not a front-end developer and this website testifies to that fact.

## Content structure

All page content is in src/markdown-pages.

The website will follow a simple structure:

- `/` - homepage (index.md)
- `/experience` - who I have worked for (experince.md)
- `/coach` - who I can help (coach.md) [TODO]
- `/articles` - content I have written (articles.md) [TODO]
- `/contact` - how to get in touch (contact.md)
