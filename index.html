    I lead talented engineers to build high-value software for interesting
    companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I'm happily building on-demand personalised childrens books and stories at 
    <a href="https://www.wonderbly.com">Wonderbly</a>.  As VP Engineering, I lead a multi-disciplinary
    team to help ensure our inspiring ideas for children are published and sold. Obligatory

  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to Wonderbly I was Chief Software Architect at
    <a href="http://www.mttnow.com">Mobile Travel Technologies</a> where I led
    the design and development of their
    <a href="http://www.mttnow.com/news/mtt-concierge-live-wins-at-the-mobile-innovation-awards">
      award-winning</a> product suite before its acquisition by Travelport. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I have board-level experience as founder and CTO and have worked
    for a range of businesses including scrappy startups in London, medium-sized
    B2B business in Dublin to a multi-billion dollar corporate in NYC.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work closely with founders and senior business leaders.  As a consequence
    I have been responsible for the technical delivery of three successful
    acquisitions: Wiley &rarr; Whatsonwhen, Google &rarr; Frommers and most
    recently Travelport &rarr; MTT.
