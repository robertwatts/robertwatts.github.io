  <p>
    I lead talented engineers to build high-value software for interesting
    companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I'm happily beavering away with the great people at Google
    Ventures backed <a href="https://www.lostmy.name">Lost My Name</a>.  As
    Head of Platform, we are building new tools to help creative people
    get their amazing work published. By the way,
    <a href="https://making.lostmy.name">we're hiring</a>!
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to that I was Chief Software Architect at
    <a href="http://www.mttnow.com">Mobile Travel Technologies</a> where I led
    the design and development of their
    <a href="http://www.mttnow.com/news/mtt-concierge-live-wins-at-the-mobile-innovation-awards">
      award-winning</a> product suite.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've had board-level experience as founder and CTO and have worked
    for a range of businesses including scrappy startups in London, medium-sized
    B2B business in Dublin to a multi-billion dollar corporate in NYC.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work closely with founders and senior business leaders.  As a consequence
    I have been responsible for the technical delivery of three successful
    acquisitions: Wiley &rarr; Whatsonwhen, Google &rarr; Frommers and most
    recently Travelport &rarr; MTT.
